        <h5>Holy Communion for the  sick and housebound</h5>
  <p>The letter of St James, Chapter  5, verse 14: &ldquo;Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church,  and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.&rdquo;<br>
  If you or anyone you know is  ill, either in hospital or at home, and would like to receive the Church&rsquo;s  ministry in anointing and Holy Communion, please let Fr Nigel know and he will  come and visit you/your family and friends </p>    
        <h5>NHS Track and Trace Facility</h5>
        <p>The new NHS Track and Trace app has launched and you will find in our church the QR code to ‘check in’ at the entrance of the church. It's very straight forward and takes seconds to check in using the app. Simply download the app from the Android or iPhone app stores, depending on your Smartphone, enter the first part of your postcode and the app is set up. Then on the app click on ‘venue check in’ and line up the QR code with the box on your screen. If you use the app to ‘check in’ this takes the place of our own register although we will still have the register for those who do not have access to the app.</p>
  <p>ROOF’US FUND: WONDERFUL NEWS<br>
    We have some wonderful news for you. Our target of  £25,000 has been reached. Now £25,152.90) It is all thanks to your generous  support by way of your donations of money, giving time to bake on coffee  mornings, buying the Roof’us slates, doing the weekly Numbers Up game buying  tickets for and donating prizes to the raffles. Special thanks to the fund-raising  team for all their hard work, effort and enthusiasm. <br>
    We still, of course, need you to continue in this  way, as in addition to what we previously intended doing, we have had to add  extensive floor repairs, stone work and stain glass window refurbishment, full  decorating throughout, improving disabled access, the WC and new kitchen  facilities, new heating system… Yes, it does seem like an endless task, <u>but</u> it is a very worthwhile cause <u>and</u> our duty to restore and maintain such  a beautiful church building for future generations to come.<br>
    We also have to prove to the grant awarding bodies,  as well as to the Diocese, that we are active parishioners and care enough to  raise our share of the upkeep costs. <br>
If anyone wishes to make a cheque donation towards  our refurbishment please make it payable to: The  Sacred Heart Refurbishment Fund. Thank you.</p>
